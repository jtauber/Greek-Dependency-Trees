# Greek-Dependency-Trees
Collection of hand-analyzed ancient Greek dependency trees.

The Guidelines included here are by Bamman and Crane (Greek) and Bamman, et al. (Latin) from the Perseids site.  Treebanking Tips is a sheet I have been developing over the years, explaining how I deal with troublesome constructions.
