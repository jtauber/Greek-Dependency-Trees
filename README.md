# Greek-Dependency-Trees
A collection of hand-analyzed dependency syntax trees of ancient Greek prose using the Arethusa program available at the Perseids Project. This collection is being constantly edited (as mistakes are pointed out and corrected) and expanded with new files. 

The Guidelines included here are by Bamman and Crane (Greek) and Bamman, et al. (Latin) from the Perseids site.  Treebanking Tips is a sheet I have been developing over the years, explaining how I deal with troublesome constructions.
